             <p>The player controls a running character in this never-ending game, and they have to dodge attackers and obstacles. The main story of the game is that the player controls 
              a figure who takes a golden idol from what looks to be an Aztec temple located in a swamp. In Temple Run, your primary goal is to escape the pursuing apes while gathering as many gold,
              red, and blue coins as you can to obtain the maximum score.</p>
